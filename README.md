It is also worth noting that 9/11 related illess stands at 4th place beating Heart Attack during this timeframe.

Among the various accident categories, Automobile crash with 43%, contributed to major police deaths. The prima facie reason could be that the major automobile crashes, perhaps, have occurred during the chases made.

The Texas Rangers (22.6%), followed by Houston Police Department (21.9%) suffered the most deaths in Texas.

Yearly trend shows the spike during the time period of around 1920-1950, and then again around 1970-1980. There was sudden spike of police deaths during 2020 and 2021. Probable reason could be Covid-19.
